# v2ray-electron
A V2Ray client built with Electron for Windows and macOS

It works as a tray application under Windows or a menu bar application under macOS.
A V2Ray process will be spawned by the app.
The app also allows you to edit the configuration file using the built-in Monaco editor.
## TODO
- Show log in app
- Set up system proxy
- Support PAC file
- Fix syntax error in Monaco editor
